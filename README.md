# PythonPrintOwnCode
I just wanna do some silly stuff on python

## How to run the code
* If you wanna check it, run `print_myself_to_console.py`, and it'll print own code to console
* If you wanna check the whole project, run `print_myself_as_turtle.py`, and see the magic. There are some settings, which you can change in that file.

## How to get letters as correct code
1. Check `font/get_letters.py`. If needed, change path to your file with bitmapped letters, and settings (they are different for different files)
2. Run the file, and it will produce a file `font/test_printed_chars.py`. Rut it, and chech, is everything correct
3. Replace `letters` variable with your generated variable in `print_myself_as_turtle.py` or `print_myself_to_console.py` (last one is made mostly for tests)
4. Check, if the heart is present in your variable, 'cause it's the char, I added manually
5. Enjoy the result
