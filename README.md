# PythonPrintOwnCode
I just wanna do some silly stuff on python

## Plan
1. Represent each char with bitmap (create tool for this)
2. Read file
3. Print it

## How to start
1. Run `font/get_letters.py`
2. Run created file (`font/test_printed_chars.py`) to check, if all letters were displayed correctly
