# PythonPrintOwnCode
I just wanna do some silly stuff on python

## Quichstart
Just run `print_myself_as_turtle.py`

## Start
* If you wanna check it, run `print_myself_to_console.py`, and it'll print own code to console
* If you wanna check the whole project, run `print_myself_as_turtle.py`, and see the magic. There are some settings, which you can change in that file.

## Custom letters
1. Check `get_letters.py`. If needed, change path to your file with bitmapped letters, and settings (they are different for different files)
2. Run the file, and it will produce a file `letters.py`.
3. Check, if the heart is present in `letters` variable there, 'cause it's the char, I added manually
4. Run `print_myself_as_turtle.py`, and enjoy the result

## Heart symbol
Here's my version of heart, but you can use any other (but check its dimension)
```
'♡': [
    [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0],
    [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
    [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],
    [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0],
    [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
],
```
